*Summary*:
1. Finished FFT convolution documentation and matched with direct convolution method.
1. Plotted result of duality relation for instantaneous measurement with adjoint fields with uncertainty.

*Target*
1. Obtain time averaged measurement data and visualize the evolution of the measurement with increasing measured time period.
1. Check duality relation between time averaged measurement with uncertain adjoint fields.
1. Document method applied to do uncertainty quantification analysis.
